## Problem Statement
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.  Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task

### 3. **Total Active Users:**

| **Mini Ultra Saver Pack (750 MB/Day for 28 Days)** | 31.45                |

### Plan-wise Insights:
   - **Smart Recharge Pack** is the **highest revenue-generating pack** at **419.93 Cr**, contributing significantly to Atliq's overall revenue.
     - This pack’s popularity may be attributed to its **3-month validity** and **high data offering**, making it appealing for regular users.
   - **Super Saviour Pack** and **Ultra Fast Mega Pack** are also high contributors, with **297.53 Cr** and **185.95 Cr**, respectively.
     - These plans provide **value over a long duration**, suggesting users prefer **longer-duration data plans** that give more flexibility.
   - The **Elite Saver Pack** also performs well at **261.54 Cr**, indicating a **strong mid-tier customer base**.
   - Lower revenue-generating packs include the **Mini Data Saver Pack (500 MB/Day)** at **31.45 Cr** and **Combo TopUp at 22.68 Cr**, which are likely targeted toward users with minimal data needs.


## Conclusions:
1. **Revenue Growth through Premium Packs:**
   - The **Smart Recharge Pack** and **Super Saviour Pack** are the backbone of Atliq's revenue. They should be promoted further, possibly with added value to attract more users from the competition.
   
2. **Unsubscribed Users:**
   - With **125.90 L unsubscribed users**, Atliq must **prioritize retention strategies** and offer attractive incentives for users to stay, such as loyalty discounts or exclusive 5G features.
   
3. **Market Share Decline:**
   - Atliq's **declining market share** needs to be addressed with strategic initiatives. Competitors like PIO and Britel are gaining, and without action, Atliq risks further erosion.
   - Consider **market differentiation strategies**—targeting niche user groups, innovating with bundled services, or offering competitive pricing.

4. **Plan Optimization:**
   - Given the **successful higher-end plans**, Atliq should assess whether increasing offerings in the **premium segment** would drive further growth. At the same time, it may want to reconsider low-revenue plans like **Combo TopUp** to optimize profitability.


## Suggested Actions:
1. **Improve Churn Management:**
   - Deep dive into the reasons for high unsubscribed users and implement **retention programs** targeting those likely to leave.
   
2. **Boost Mid-to-Premium Tier Plans:**
   - The most revenue is coming from longer, higher data packs. **Expand offers in this range** and potentially bundle with other services to make these plans more attractive.
   
3. **Market Share Focus:**
   - Aggressively pursue customers from competitors, particularly in areas where Atliq's market share is declining, such as with data-centric or younger demographics.

4. **Targeted Promotions:**
   - Consider **time-limited promotions** on popular plans to **draw customers from competitors** and reduce churn while emphasizing the value of Atliq’s 5G services.
