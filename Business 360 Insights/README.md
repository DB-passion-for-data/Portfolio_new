## Project Introduction: Atliq Hardwares FMCG Analysis
In this project, we analyze key operational areas of Atliq Hardwares, a prominent player in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) domain. The primary objective is to gain comprehensive insights into current market trends and business performance to identify actionable strategies that will further boost sales and improve margins.

The analysis is structured across multiple business views:

**Finance View**: Evaluates revenue streams, cost structure, profitability, and financial efficiency to ensure sustainable growth and identify opportunities for margin improvement.

**Marketing View**: Examines campaign effectiveness, customer engagement, and market reach to understand how marketing initiatives impact brand visibility and product demand.

**Sales View**: Analyzes sales performance, product trends, and customer demographics to uncover patterns that can drive increased sales and target high-potential markets.

**Executive View**: Provides a strategic overview, combining key performance indicators (KPIs) from all departments to facilitate informed decision-making at the executive level.

**Supply Chain View**: Assesses logistics, inventory levels, and supplier performance to identify areas where supply chain optimization can reduce costs and enhance product availability.

By integrating insights from these perspectives, the project outlines the next steps Atliq Hardwares can take to maintain its competitive edge in the FMCG market, while focusing on maximizing profitability and market share.

## Problem Statement
There is an imaginary company called AtliQ Hardware and discuss its business model. It is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America.

**1. Overall Sales Performance**

**Net Sales**: Atliq Hardwares achieved net sales of $3.74bn in 2022, showing an impressive growth of 353.5% compared to the benchmark (BM) of $823.85M.

**Gross Margin (GM):** The gross margin sits at 38.08%, a slight improvement of +4.37% from the benchmark (36.49%). This indicates efficient cost control and good pricing strategies.

**Net Profit:** However, Net Profit has drastically fallen by -13.98% (from -6.63% to -110.79% below BM). This significant decrease in profitability is an area of concern.

**2. Profit and Loss Breakdown**

**Gross Sales:** Increased sharply to $7.37bn, representing a 342.75% increase over the benchmark.

**Deductions and Discounts:**

Pre-invoice deductions have increased by 340%, which suggests that discounts or promotions are considerably higher.

Post-invoice deductions and discounts have also increased substantially, by 341.54% and 298.09% respectively, further contributing to the high cost burdens.

**Manufacturing Cost:** Up by 341.42%, indicating increasing production costs, potentially from supply chain issues or inflation.

**Freight Cost:** This has seen a massive rise of 355.64%, pointing to possible logistical challenges or cost inflation in shipping.

**Total COGS:** The cost of goods sold (COGS) also rose by 341.53%, significantly impacting the gross profit.

**3. Net Sales Over Time**

The chart shows that net sales have remained relatively stable in 2022, with some increase towards the last few months compared to the benchmark (BM). This stability suggests some degree of demand consistency but no significant upward trend to match the cost increases.

**4. Regional Performance**

APAC region contributes the most to profit and loss (P&L) with $1,923.77M, growing by 335.27%.

NA (North America) follows with $1,022.09M, marking the highest growth rate of 474.40%.

EU has a significant contribution of $775.48M, growing by 286.26%, but the LATAM region shows relatively lower performance, with only $14.82M.

**5. Product/Segment Performance**

**Notebook:** The strongest performing segment with $1,580.43M, showing 493.06% growth.

**Desktop:** Also performed well with $711.08M, boasting an exceptional growth of 1,431.55%.

**Accessories and Peripherals:** They experienced healthy growth, but Networking products saw a negative growth of -14.89%, requiring attention to regain market share.

**6. Areas of Concern**

**Net Profit Decline:** Despite strong sales and gross margin performance, the decline in net profit by -13.98% is alarming. It is likely driven by significantly higher costs across various components (manufacturing, freight, and other costs), despite improved sales.

**High Cost Burdens:** Increased deductions (both pre- and post-invoice), as well as manufacturing and logistics costs, have put pressure on the bottom line.

**Networking Segment Decline:** The networking segmentâ€™s negative growth indicates a possible loss of market relevance or competitive disadvantage in this area.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

**Cost Optimization:** Immediate focus on reducing manufacturing and freight costs, possibly by improving supply chain efficiencies, reducing discounts or negotiating better terms with suppliers.

**Profitability Enhancement:** Given the drastic fall in net profit, exploring pricing strategies, managing operational expenses, and reducing unnecessary deductions should be priorities.

**Product Focus:** Consider repositioning or innovating within the Networking segment to recover market share, while further leveraging the success of Desktop and Notebook products.
